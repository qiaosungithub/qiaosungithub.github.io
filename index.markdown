I am an undergraduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Class of 2028. My major is [Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (Course 6-4) and [Mathematics](https://math.mit.edu/index.php) (Course 18). 

**Research**: I am currently an [UROP](https://urop.mit.edu/) student under [Kaiming He](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kaiming/)'s computer vision group, where I work with [Hanhong Zhao](https://hope7happiness.github.io/#about-me) and [Zhicheng Jiang](https://jzc-2007.github.io/). My research focuses on generative models, especially for Diffusion Models and Flow Matching.

**Previously**: I graduated from [Shanghai High School](https://www.shs.cn/) in 2024. I won a gold medal in the 2023 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). During my last high school year, I study at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Tsinghua University as a precollege student.

My resume is attached [here](/assets/resume.pdf).
